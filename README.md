## Text-to-Speech Program

Text-To-Speech python package called "pyttsx3" allows developers to use online and offline. When using the package, you are able to change the VOICE, RATE and VOLUME of the speech. In this program, I was able to adjust the rate to be a bit slower "110" as well as the voice itself to female tone.
